		<h4>My thoughts</h4>
	<p>This concert was alright, I think. I remained with everyone and didn’t mess up anything big, which was a relief. There was a little shaky feeling in some of it — especially re-coming in with the violin at the second half — but no one complained, so maybe no one noticed. People said I played alright, which was nice to hear, though it’s hard to feel proud about it. Nonetheless, it was nice to have been up on stage. I’ve improved since last year, definitely.</p>
	<p>This concert sort of taught me to keep it together, even if I wasn't completely confident in yourself. It was weird doing a show in front of all those people, but I think I deal with pressure a little better now.</p>

		<h4>My thoughts</h4>
	<p>I'm a bit exhausted but also a bit jittery after that. It was great to finally execute all that we have been practicing. I was anxious beforehand, but once I got up there, I was in it. There was a couple spots where I felt as though I could have been more precise, but overall it was okay. Some of the rest of them were really good though, which leads to wonder as to how I really sounded. Either way, it's over now and I didn't totally ruin it.</p>
	<p>Honestly, I find that I'm more detail-oriented since I've been a part of this. Such as, I realize how much little things can add up when you have other people to play with. It's sort of altered the way I hear.</p>

		<h4>My thoughts</h4>
	<p>This concert was better than I anticipated. I played most of what I rehearsed, and nothing completely broke down. Some places weren’t as slick as I wished, but I guess that's what happens. People applauded a lot, which was great. I was always thinking afterward if my tone was sounding thin in some places, but perhaps I'm worrying over it. It wasn’t flawless, I wished I could’ve played the pizzicato notes way louder, but I worked hard and I think it came through, even if only a little.</p>
<p>I'm not always confident, but I feel like that performance helped teach me what it's like to continue giving your best. That's probably worth something at least.</p>
