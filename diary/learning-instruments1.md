<p>Growing up, the piano in my house always felt off-limits for me. My family members who played the piano made it seem it was more for them, and they used to grumble about other pianists somehow always disturbing their musical journey. But now, they've either stopped or moved away, leaving the piano in our house sitting lonely in a corner. When I started the music course at school, I figured learning the piano might help me in class. Plus, I actually really like piano music. So, here’s my documentation of my piano journey! My first lesson was on the 21st of October 2023.</p>
<p>Now I am just a few weeks into playing the piano, but so far, I'm loving it. It feels magical to sometimes just sit down at the piano make time disappear.</p>
<p>I've been doing mostly exercises and children's pieces, but I can’t wait to get to actual compositions. I have also for the first time in my life properly learned how the pedals actually work.</p>
<p>I had a bit of a setback with what my teacher calls the "five-finger position" (which I don’t know the technical name for). I spent a few weeks practising it, only to find out I got it all wrong and had to start over. I ended up getting a bit worried about whether or not I could manage challenges like these, but some tips from my teacher and online clips ended up helping me a lot.</p>
<p>This made me start thinking about correct practice methods. I read up and asked my teacher a little and am now really trying to focus on slow and steady practice and trying to minimise mistakes. I'm being cautious not to jump into pieces that are too advanced as well, because I discovered online that it can mess with you later if you don't get the basics right from the start.</p>
<p>One slightly funny and very convenient moment so far is that I was learning about inversions parallel to my music class in school, which I really think helped me understanding the concept.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am happy with my experience so far.</p>

<p>I have been playing the violin for a couple years now, and while I have developed an appreciation for the instrument, the sense of it being too complex for me makes me question my competence and end-goal with this learning journey.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I didn't take me violin lessons seriously at the start, and now I’m battling the consequences. The feeling of playing catch-up is both frustrating and challenging.</p>
<p>A recent setback occurred during the Christmas break when my very musical family all came to Luxembourg to gather for Christmas. Shyness sort of took over, and I stopped practising for a while.</p>
