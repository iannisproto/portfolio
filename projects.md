<h2>History Research Project</h2>
<p>For S6 History, I needed to select a topic I was really interested in and write a research essay about it. I knew I needed to make a connection to music, however, since I was interested in a topic of great historic importance, I chose to write about the battle between Joseph Stalin and Dmitri Shostakovich. This was a great way to write about some of Shostakovich's great pieces, such as Symphony No. 7 and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. I was even able to analyse these a little bit, which was great. This project as a whole was interesting because I feel that I am much more knowledgeable about Shostakovich now.</p>

<h2>Short essay on R&B</h2>
<p>This was a short text I had to write as a check up on my understandings of a lesson we had on the history of R&B.</p>
<h3>Influence of jazz fusion on contemporary music</h3>
<p>Jazz fusion was a groundbreaking musical style in a time when society was under a lot of political pressure. Bands like Weather Report and artists such as Jaco Pastorius, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Miles Davis helped push for change by mixing different sounds and introducing new instruments into jazz. They created music that spoke to a generation ready for freedom in progress and individuality.</p>
<p>Weather Report, for example, mixed the free spirit of jazz with the punch of rock and the groove of funk. Their works featured instruments like the saxophone, electric bass, electric piano, and drums. By using these tools in an innovative way they gave listeners a new way to experience music, which showed a bit that even through radical political times and new changes, creative innovation was a way to connect to others.</p>
<p>Jaco Pastorius, the somewhat legendary electric bassist, changed the way the bass was played. His approach on the fret-less electric bass brought smooth, singing tones and new textures to the sound, which are still popularly used today. His style encouraged new ideas ways of music to replace the traditional ones.</p>
<p>Chick Corea, known for his work on both the acoustic piano and modern keyboards like synthesizers, was always pushed musical boundaries, focusing on what he personally found beautiful. Similarly, Herbie Hancock used the electric piano and synthesizers to compose a more modern sound. His famous and classic album Head Hunters combined familiar jazz elements with electronic rhythms, which was new and a way to portray himself as unique and personal.</p>
<p>Miles Davis, the master trumpet player, was another key figure. His album Bitches Brew fused jazz with rock and funk, producing a sound that was originally critiqued by many, because it was so different and unheard of before. In doing so, Davis and his band members used music as a tool to change and inspiring others.</p>
