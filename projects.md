<h2>History Research Project</h2>
<p>For S6 History, I needed to select a topic I was really interested in and write a research essay about it. I knew I needed to make a connection to music, however, since I was interested in a topic of great historic importance, I chose to write about the battle between Joseph Stalin and Dmitri Shostakovich. This was a great way to write about some of Shostakovich's great pieces, such as Symphony No. 7 and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. I was even able to analyse these a little bit, which was great. This project as a whole was interesting because I feel that I am much more knowledgeable about Shostakovich now.</p>
